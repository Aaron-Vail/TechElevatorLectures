Programming
-Data and/vs Functionality

Variables
-Variable has name and type and holds data
-Variable names can’t start with numbers but can have numbers in them
-Variable names are case sensitive
-camelCaseIsBestPractice for variable names

int x; - declares a variable named “x” that can hold an integer
x = 10; - defines x as 10
-In above example, 10 is a literal
= - assignment
int x = 10; - declaration and definition in one line

Data Types
int = integers - whole numbers
Ex: int x = 10

double = double - number with decimals
Ex: double y = 2.0;

String = string - text or string of characters - Declared with capital S
Ex: String myName = “Bobby Dorrance”;

boolean = boolean - true or false
Ex: boolean isOn = true;

char = character

-Data types starting with lowercase letters(int, double, boolean) are primitive or the building blocks of a program

System.out.println - print to command line and start new line afterwards

Java Files
package - research
public class - research

MATH!
+ - add
- - subtract
*	-	multiply
/	-	divide
%	-	modulo(remainder)

Concatenation - Adding strings together
Ex: “Bobby “ + “Dorrance” = “Bobby Dorrance”
